This is my text

*Single asterisk is italicized*

**Double asterisk is bold**

I don't know why the line is following me...

---This is a horizontal line---
and some more text

A `print` function in Python displays the text or variable passed in the function as output:

```python
text = ‘This is a sentence that you would like to display.’
print(text)
```
